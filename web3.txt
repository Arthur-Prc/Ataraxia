# Ataraxia

## A Home‑Scale Subsistence & Resilience Protocol

Ataraxia is an open, reproducible protocol for **subsistence infrastructure**, designed to turn a common household into a **low‑maintenance, semi‑autonomous resource and income node**.

The project focuses on **real, currently viable hardware activities**, prioritizing:

* Plug‑and‑play operation
* CPU‑based and low‑power workloads
* Storage‑backed networks
* Minimal human intervention
* Predictable costs

This repository documents the **operational doctrine**, hardware stack, and daily routines required to keep Ataraxia running.

## Core Principles

* **Subsistence First**: Cover knowledge, data, and infrastructure needs before profit.
* **Low Cognitive Load**: Systems must survive neglect.
* **Hardware‑Backed Value**: No speculative DeFi or yield games.
* **Modular & Replaceable**: Every component can fail without collapsing the system.
* **Legal & Boring**: No gray‑area activities.

## What Ataraxia Produces

### 1. Decentralized Storage Yield

Ataraxia participates in multiple **storage‑based Web3 networks**, monetizing unused disk space and uptime.

#### STORJ

* Encrypted decentralized cloud storage
* Requires stable internet and high uptime
* Paid in STORJ tokens
* CPU usage: Low
* Disk usage: High

#### SIA

* Decentralized storage contracts
* Higher technical complexity
* Requires collateral locking
* CPU usage: Low–Medium
* Disk usage: High

#### Filecoin (Lotus / Light setups)

* Storage‑focused blockchain
* Heavy hardware for full nodes (optional)
* Lightweight participation preferred
* CPU usage: Medium
* Disk usage: High

These systems transform **idle disks into long‑term yield infrastructure**.

---

### 2. Residential Bandwidth Monetization (Optional)

#### HoneyGain

* Passive residential bandwidth sharing
* Runs on spare devices
* Low revenue but fully automated
* CPU usage: Minimal
* Risk profile: Low

HoneyGain is included strictly as a **background yield layer**, not a core dependency.

---

### 3. CPU‑Based Background Workloads

* Storage proof verification
* Hashing, sealing, and auditing tasks
* Monitoring, logging, and encryption

These workloads are intentionally limited to **CPU‑only or low‑end GPU‑optional systems**, avoiding mining arms races.

---

## Recommended Hardware Stack

### Base Node (Minimum Viable Ataraxia)

* Raspberry Pi 5 or Mini‑PC (Intel N100 / Ryzen Embedded)
* 16–32 GB RAM
* External HDDs or SSDs (8–40 TB total)
* Gigabit Ethernet
* Linux (Debian / Ubuntu Server)

### Storage Layer

* Multiple independent disks (no single point of failure)
* SMART monitoring enabled
* Encrypted at rest

### Power & Resilience

* UPS or small solar buffer (optional)
* Automatic reboot and watchdogs

## Operational Reality (Important)

This is **not high‑yield passive income**.

Expected characteristics:

* Long ROI cycles
* Revenue mostly offsets power and connectivity costs
* True value lies in **resilience, autonomy, and optionality**

Ataraxia is designed to:

* Reduce dependency on centralized services
* Preserve knowledge offline
* Generate small but real network‑native income

---

## Daily & Weekly Operations

Operations are fully documented and tracked via Trello‑importable routines:

* Node health checks
* Storage integrity audits
* Dataset synchronization
* Security reviews
* Encrypted backups

(See `ataraxia_daily_ops_trello.csv`)

---

## What Ataraxia Is NOT

* Not a mining farm
* Not DeFi farming
* Not speculative token trading
* Not "get rich quick"

It is **boring on purpose**.

---

## Roadmap

* LoRa mesh knowledge nodes
* Offline AI knowledge indexing
* Barter equivalence ledger
* Community‑shared subsistence protocols

---

## License

MIT — use, fork, adapt, survive.

Ataraxia is about **calm through preparedness**.
