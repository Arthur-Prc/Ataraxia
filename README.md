# Ataraxia

**Ataraxia** is an open, recurring **household subsistence and resilience protocol** focused on predictable resource production and **non-speculative, hardware-backed income generation**.

This project documents how an ordinary house or apartment can sustainably produce **food, energy, compute, and digital value**, combining physical subsistence with **Web3 infrastructure roles** such as mining and node operation — not bandwidth resale, not hype-driven token schemes.

Ataraxia is designed to be:

* Calm
* Boring
* Predictable
* Auditable

---

## Design Principles

* **Small-space compatible** (apartment or small house)
* **Low-to-moderate startup cost**
* **Hardware-backed value** (real resources, not promises)
* **Composable modules** (each unit stands alone)
* **Automation-first mindset**
* **Energy-aware** (electricity and heat are first-class constraints)
* **Legality-first** (no illegal production or evasion)

---

## What Can Be Produced in a Limited Household Space

### 1. Food Production (High Yield per m²)

#### 🍄 Mushrooms

* Oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus)
* Lion’s Mane
* Shiitake (small scale)

**Rationale:**

* Vertical stacking
* Fast growth cycles (2–4 weeks)
* Low light requirements
* Uses waste substrates

**Typical space:** closet, laundry room, garage corner

---

#### 🌱 Microgreens

* Broccoli
* Radish
* Kale
* Pea shoots
* Sunflower

**Rationale:**

* Harvest in 7–14 days
* Extremely high nutrient density
* Minimal tooling

**Typical space:** shelving with LED lighting

---

#### 🌿 Culinary & Medicinal Herbs

* Basil
* Mint
* Rosemary
* Thyme
* Oregano
* Lemon balm

**Rationale:**

* Continuous harvest
* Easy drying and preservation
* Reduces grocery dependency

**Typical space:** windowsills, balconies, vertical planters

---

### 2. Animal Protein (Micro-scale, Optional)

#### 🥚 Quail (where legally allowed)

* Eggs and limited meat production

**Rationale:**

* Very small footprint
* Quiet
* High feed-to-protein efficiency

**Typical space:** small outdoor or ventilated enclosure

---

### 3. Preservation & Value Multiplication

#### 🫙 Preservation & Fermentation

* Mushroom drying
* Herb drying
* Pickles
* Sauerkraut
* Kimchi

**Rationale:**

* Shelf-life extension
* Nutritional density
* Trade or sale potential

**Typical space:** kitchen shelves

---

### 4. Digital & Knowledge Production (Zero Physical Space)

#### 💻 Documentation & Software

* Playbooks
* Protocols
* Checklists
* Automation scripts

**Examples:**

* Remote work security hygiene
* Infrastructure automation
* Household ops tracking

---

## 5. Compute-Based Web3 Production (Core Focus)

Ataraxia explicitly avoids:

* Bandwidth resale
* Consumer VPN exit traffic
* Speculative token farming
* Social coordination games

Instead, it focuses on **compute- and hardware-backed roles** that convert electricity and silicon into verifiable output.

---

### ⛏️ Crypto Mining (CPU / GPU / ASIC)

#### CPU Mining

* Suitable for RandomX-class algorithms
* Low barrier to entry
* Educational and experimental

**Hardware profile:**

* Modern multi-core CPU (e.g., Ryzen-class)
* 16–32 GB RAM
* Efficient cooling

---

#### GPU Mining

* Higher throughput per watt than CPUs
* Requires thermal and power planning

**Hardware profile:**

* Single or multiple mid-range GPUs
* Quality PSU
* Active ventilation

---

#### ASIC Mining (Optional, Advanced)

* Highest efficiency per hash
* High noise and heat

**Hardware profile:**

* Dedicated ASIC units
* Electrical and acoustic isolation

---

### 🧱 Blockchain Nodes (Non-mining)

#### Full Nodes

* Contribute to network decentralization
* No speculative behavior

**Typical requirements:**

* 4–8 CPU cores
* 16–32 GB RAM
* 1–2 TB SSD
* Always-on uptime

---

#### Validator / Staking Nodes (Optional)

* Requires locked capital
* Requires high uptime discipline

**Used selectively** where risk and jurisdiction allow.

---

### ♻️ Heat & Energy Reuse

* Mining heat reused for:

  * Room heating
  * Mushroom incubation
* Solar-assisted baseline power where feasible

Energy is treated as a **closed-loop constraint**, not an externality.

---

## 6. Waste → Resource Loops

* Coffee grounds → mushroom substrate
* Food scraps → compost
* Compute heat → biological production

---

## Modular Repository Structure

Each production line is a **self-contained module**:

* `food/mushrooms`
* `food/microgreens`
* `food/herbs`
* `protein/quail`
* `preservation/fermentation`
* `compute/mining`
* `compute/nodes`
* `energy/solar`
* `automation/monitoring`

Each module documents:

* Space required
* Power usage
* Time per week
* Initial cost
* Predictable output
* Failure modes

---

## Long-Term Vision

Ataraxia aims to become:

* A **household-scale economic operating system**
* A library of **boring but reliable subsistence strategies**
* A reference for calm, hardware-backed autonomy

---

> *Ataraxia is not about growth, hype, or escape.*
> *It is about stability under constraint.*
